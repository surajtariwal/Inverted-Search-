# Inverted-Search-
A C-based Inverted Index Search Engine that builds a hash-table driven index from multiple text files and enables fast word searching with file occurrence and frequency tracking.

📌 Overview

This project implements an Inverted Index Search Engine using C programming.
It reads multiple text files, builds a hash-based inverted index, and allows efficient word searching across files.

The project demonstrates strong understanding of:

Data Structures,
File Handling,
Dynamic Memory Allocation,
Hash Tables,
Linked Lists.
